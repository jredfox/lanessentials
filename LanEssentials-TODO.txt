TODO:
- nuke shouldn't explode blocks
- Permission Levels
- Tabbing
- Doesn't support other players / ents
- make every command configurable [enabled, name, alias]

Maybe:
- multi-world / bungee and uis to interact with
- configruable guis that the player can transport to another gamemode
- more gamemodes like bedwars
- economy integration
